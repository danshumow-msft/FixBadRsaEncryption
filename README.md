These python scripts implement the plaintext search, to return a list of possible plaintexts 
that have been encrypted to an RSA public key with exponent e and modulus N, such that 
e is not relatively prime to phi(N) - where phi denotes Euler's totient function.

## Requirements
These scripts require Python >= 3.4 to run.
